# Systemic credit freezes in financial lending networks

Daron Acemoglu, Asuman Ozdaglar, James Siderius and Alireza Tahbaz-Saleh

2021 

## Introduction
- Credit freezes induced by the fear of default contagion.
- Fears were visible before the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
  - The run on Bear Stearns on March 12, 2008.
  
## Model
- Agents: A representative depositor, banks, entrepreneures.
 - The depositor only lends out funds, with an opportunity cost.
 - The banks hold asset and have liquidity shocks.
 - The entrepreneures require bulky investment with a fixed return. 

- The potential network is given: G.
- Restricted by G, agents decide the lending contract relationship.

## Model
- Three periods:
  - t=0: Banks and depositor offer lending contracts, specifying lending interest rates.
  - t=1: Banks and entreprenurs decide the amount of borrowings.
  - t=2: Debt due. Shocks are realized. 

- Agents at t=0 foresee the equilibrium at t=1,2.

## Equilibrium
- t=2: Repayment equilibrium.
- t=1: Borrowing equilibrium.
- t=0: Interest rate equilibrium.


-Each equilibrium is a network or weighted graph.
