# Systemic credit freezes in financial lending networks

Daron Acemoglu, Asuman Ozdaglar, James Siderius and Alireza Tahbaz-Saleh

2021 

## Introduction
- Credit freezes are induced by the fear of default contagion.
- Fears were visible before the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
  - The run on Bear Stearns on March 12, 2008.
  
## Model
- Agents: A representative depositor, banks, entrepreneurs.
  - The depositor only lends out funds with an opportunity cost/ default-free rate.
  - The banks hold the asset and have liquidity shocks, which are independent across banks.
  - The entrepreneurs require a bulky investment with a fixed return. 
- There is intermediation friction.
  - The potential network is given: G.
- Restricted by G, agents decide the lending contract relationship.

## Credit Freezes
- Credit freezes:
- Systemic credit freezes:

## Model
- Three periods:
  - t=0: Banks and depositor offer lending contracts, specifying lending interest rates.
  - t=1: Banks and entrepreneurs decide the borrowing amount.
  - t=2: Debt due. Shocks are realized. 

- Agents at t=0 foresee the equilibrium at t=1,2.

## Equilibrium
- t=2: Repayment equilibrium.
- t=1: Borrowing equilibrium.
- t=0: Interest rate equilibrium.


- Each equilibrium is a network or weighted graph.
